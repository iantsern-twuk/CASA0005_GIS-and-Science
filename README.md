## Final project

#### project1: New York Evictions [(Report)](https://raw.githack.com/iantsern-twuk/CASA0005_GIS-and-Science/refs/heads/master/Practice_exam.html)
This study aims to analyze eviction spatial patterns in New York City, with a focus on 2020 data, to explore whether evictions occur in specific community districts and whether they are more prevalent in commercial or residential properties. By examining temporal trends from 2017 to 2024, the research will provide context to the 2020 data and use various analytical methods, such as kernel density maps, choropleth maps, and bar charts, to visualize eviction distribution across the city and compare patterns in different property types. Additionally, the study will employ DBSCAN clustering to identify potential spatial clustering of evictions, contributing valuable insights for policy-making and tenant protection strategies.

#### project2: City of Charlotte Safe Streets for All [(Report)](https://raw.githack.com/iantsern-twuk/CASA0005_GIS-and-Science/refs/heads/master/Final_exam.html)
This study aims to investigate the relationship between population density and pedestrian crash rates in Charlotte, seeking to determine whether areas with higher population density are more prone to pedestrian crashes or if the occurrences are independent of population density patterns. By analyzing temporal trends from 2019 to 2023, the research will identify the pattern of pedestrian crashes, visualize the spatial distribution of incidents across community districts using kernel density maps, and calculate the crash density using metrics such as crashes per square kilometer or per capita through K-means clustering. The study will also consider limitations such as the uncertainty regarding how intersections were initially evaluated and the need to focus on suburban areas where data may be scarce but still critical for improving pedestrian safety.
